This Xiao Liu Ren calculator uses the current lunar month, day, and hour to perform its calculations. The application determines the positions of the month, day, and hour within the six palaces (大安, 留連, 速喜, 赤口, 小吉, 空亡) and provides short explanations of the resulting divination. This self-contained web app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
